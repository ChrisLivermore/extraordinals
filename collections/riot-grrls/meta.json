    "value-proposiion":"The answer is simple. With the punks and dudes capturing all the ordinals' buzz, it was about time that girls and dudettes have their say as well. While the term Riot Grrls.. is not new but it is totally underrepresented in the NFTs ecosystem since the time NFTs became a thing. We decided to create Riot Grrls.. collection to bring a balance to the ordinals world, which was mostly punk centric. Out of all the ordinals minted so far, you would see a disproportionately large number of punks' projects. This project aims to bring some gender diversity in the ordinals world with these fierce girls.",
